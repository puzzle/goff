GOFF
===

Inspired from Kostis Kapelonis (Codefresh.io) talk at the KubeCon about [How to Preview and Diff Your Argo CD Deployments](https://youtu.be/X392bJX0AEs) we relased our own GitOps Diff tool (Goff). This tool helps you to preview your changes in your GitOps Repository, 

## How it works


1. Create a new branch and commit your changes in your Kustomize deployment
 ![GitHub Diff](doc/img/github-diff.png)
2. Run your pipeline, Goff renders the Base and the Overlays and calculate the diff between the source and target branch.
3. Check the auto generated comment in your Pull request and review the changes
