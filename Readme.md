# GOFF

Inspired from Kostis Kapelonis (Codefresh.io) talk at the KubeCon about [How to Preview and Diff Your Argo CD Deployments](https://youtu.be/X392bJX0AEs) we relased our own GitOps Diff tool (Goff). This tool helps you to preview your changes in your GitOps Repository.

## How it works

[Checkout the examples](doc/)

### Kustomize example

Example for Kustomization diff
```bash
#Build base and all overlays from source branch
goff kustomize build ./source/kustomize --output-dir /tmp/source/out
#Build base and all overlays from target branch
goff kustomize build ./target/kustomize --output-dir /tmp/target/out
#Diff rendered manifests
goff diff "/tmp/source" "/tmp/target" --title=Preview --output-dir .
```

1. Create a new branch and commit your changes in your Kustomize deployment

2. Run your pipeline, Goff renders the Base and the Overlays and calculate the diff between the source and target branch.
3. Check the auto generated comment in your Pull request and review the changes

### ArgoCD Application

Example for ArgoCD Application diff
```bash
#Render all ArgoCD manifests in directory from source branch
goff argocd "./source/argocd" --repoServer="reposerver:8081" --output-dir=/tmp/source/
#Render all ArgoCD manifests in directory from target branch
goff argocd "./target/argocd" --repoServer="reposerver:8081" --output-dir=/tmp/target/
#Diff rendered Kubernetes manifests
goff diff "/tmp/source" "/tmp/target" --output-dir .
```

1. Create a new branch and commit your changes in your ArgoCd Application

2. Run your pipeline, Goff renders the Appication into manifests calculate the diff between the source and target branch.
3. Check the auto generated comment in your Pull request and review the changes

## Build

### Build binary from source

```bash
go build -o goff goff 
```

### Build Image with dagger

```bash
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=....
export REGISTRY_USER=....
go run ci/main.go 
```

If you wanna try the new fancy Dagger TUI

```bash
export _EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_TUI=1
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=....
export REGISTRY_USER=....
dagger run go run ci/main.go
```
