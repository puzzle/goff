# GOFF #{{ goff.version }}

Inspired from Kostis Kapelonis (Codefresh.io) talk at the KubeCon about [How to Preview and Diff Your Argo CD Deployments](https://youtu.be/X392bJX0AEs) we relased our own GitOps Diff tool (Goff). This tool helps you to preview your changes in your GitOps Repository.

## How it works


Example for ArgoCD Application diff
```bash
#Render all ArgoCD manifests in directory from source branch
goff argocd app "./source/argocd" --repo-server="repo-server:8081" --output-dir=/tmp/source/
#Render all ArgoCD manifests in directory from target branch
goff argocd app "./target/argocd" --repo-server="repo-server:8081" --output-dir=/tmp/target/
#Diff rendered Kubernetes manifests
goff diff "/tmp/source" "/tmp/target" --output-dir .
```

1. Setup your pipeline in your GitOps repository. You can find examples integrations [for Github, Gitlab and Gitea here](integrations.md)
2. Create a new branch and commit your changes in your ArgoCd Application

3. Run your pipeline, Goff renders the Appication into manifests calculate the diff between the source and target branch.
4. Check the auto generated comment in your Pull request and review the changes
